# use date comparison to see if April Fool's has already gone for this year
# if it has, use the replace() function to get the date for next year

    afd = afd.replace(year=today.year+1)

# Now calculate the amount of time until April Fool's Day  
time_to_afd = afd - today # this creates a timedelta
